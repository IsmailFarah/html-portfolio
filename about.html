<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Embarking on my coding journey at 36 is an inspiring testament to my passion for learning and growth.
    As I dive into the world of programming and work on my first portfolio,
    I'm laying a strong foundation for an exciting new chapter in my life.
    Coding can be challenging, but with determination and life experience,
    should be well-equipped to tackle those challenges and create something meaningful.
    My first portfolio will be a milestone, showcasing my progress and the skills I've developing along the way.</p>

<p>Beyond my new coding adventure, I'm also a dedicated football fan, with a particular passion for Arsenal.
    Supporting my favorite team adds a touch of excitement to my weekends,
    it gives me a chance to unwind and enjoy the beautiful game. Just as in football, where teamwork, strategy,
    and persistence are key, you're bringing those same qualities to your coding journey,
    knowing that success comes with practice and perseverance.</p>

<p>Balancing my new interest in coding with family life is no small feat,
    but it's clear that my family is my greatest source of motivation.
    As a proud husband and parent of four, two boys and two girls I understand the importance of hard work and
    dedication.
    My journey into coding not only sets a positive example for my children
    but also shows that it's never too late to learn something new and pursue your dreams.</p>
